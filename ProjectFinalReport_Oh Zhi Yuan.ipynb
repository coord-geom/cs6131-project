    "When planning for a holiday, one would encounter a plethora of choices on where to go, what hotels to stay in etc. Typically, those who want to think less about the nitty gritty details like the itinerary would turn to tour packages where almost everything is taken care of for you. Nevertheless, it is still a overwhelming task to decide on that best deal with a bag for your buck since there are a ton of options to choose from. VoyageVault aims to solve this issue. With just a few keywords and filters, you would be able to look through all the packages of your liking and make decisions faster with less hassle.\n",

As there is much information being added, modified and removed from the system constantly, a database should be used. There is a need to retrieve information efficiently and for data to be reliable and properly maintained, so a RDBMS is preferred to other storage methods like text files."
